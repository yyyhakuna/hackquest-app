It allows developers and users to experiment with blockchain applications without using real funds."},"question2":{"problem":"How much test token can I claim one time?","answer":"It depends on the testnet gas fee and how many test tokens we have in store. Typically, it's more than enough for you to deploy one contract on testnet. If you need more, you can come back and claim again after 24 hours."},"question3":{"problem":"How long will it take to receive test tokens?","answer":"The time required to receive the testnet tokens is contingent upon the network chosen. Typically, the process should conclude within a matter of minutes, with instances of completion occurring in mere seconds being commonplace."}},"wantToDonate":"Want to donate to our faucet?","donate":"Send {symbol} to {address}"},"PressKit":{"sideBarPressKit":{"back":"Back","pressKit":"PRESS KIT","about":"About","article":"Article","logo":"Logo","link":"Link"},"about":{"stayConnected":"Stay connected with us"},"logo":{"download":"Download"}},"Auth":{"signIn":"Sign in","signUp":"Sign up","createAccount":"Create account","email":"Email","password":"Password","threePartyLogin":{"google":"{loginText} with Google","github":"{loginText} with Github","wallet":"{loginText} with Metamask"},"haveAccount":"Already have an account","welcome":"Welcome to HackQuest","inviteCode":"Invite Code","verifyText":{"lowercaseCharacters":"Lowercase characters","uppercaseCharacters":"Uppercase characters","numbers":"Numbers","charactersMinimum":"8 characters minimum","passwordFormatError":"Password format error","inviteCodeEmptyError":"Please enter your invite code","verifyEmail":"Verify your Email","verifyEmailTips":"Please verify via the link in the email and follow the instruction to login","success":"You’re all set","successTips":"Welcome to HackQuest!
